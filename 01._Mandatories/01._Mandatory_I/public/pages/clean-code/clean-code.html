<h1>Clean Code</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        Having clean code is important especially when you work in a team. When having clean code 
        it can be easier for other developers to be involved in your code instead of spending
        hours trying to understand your code.

    <p>
        Debugging is a useful tool when both testing and finding "hidden" problems in your code.
        Javascript is good at giving error trackstaces, below is an example of a typo in my code 
        where I'm trying to use a variable that is not defined.
        <pre>
            <code>
  app.listen(porf, () => console.log(`Server running on port`, port));
              ^

  ReferenceError: porf is not defined
    at file://01._Mandatories/01._Mandatory_I/app.js:12:12
    at ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:218:25)
    at async ModuleLoader.import (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:329:24)
    at async loadESM (node:internal/process/esm_loader:28:7)
    at async handleMainPromise (node:internal/modules/run_main:113:12)
            </code>
        </pre>

        When reading the stacktrace it's very easy to understand the mistake. It tells the exact line and placement of the 
        error. It also tells that I've wrote something that I have not defined. But it's not always that stacktraces will
        be this simple. Sometimes you won't even get an error and sometime it can be hard to understand it.

        <br>
        <br>
        A lazy way to debug your code is using <code>console.log()</code> and see if it logs.

<h3 id="Linters">Linters</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        Linters is a way to have clean code, it analyzes your code better than most IDE's. Most programming languages has
        a linter which is specilized in that language and it has a set of rules for that language which can vary.
        <br>
        <br>
        A common linter for Javascript is ESLint. It analyzes the code and detects errors, warnings and check how 
        the structure of the code is. It can gives tips on what to change and a common mistake it tells that I 
        also get a lot is missing a <code>;</code> at the end of a line or function.
