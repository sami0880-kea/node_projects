<h1>Introduction</h1>

        This website is a documentation of the Full Stack Course (Node.js) 2024. 
        Everything we've learned from the start of the course till now is documented 
        and will be updated throughout the rest of the course also

<h3>Categories</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        I've decided to split the documentation into categories and undercategories. 
        Each category has its own HTML page which is served by Express with Server Side Rendering.
