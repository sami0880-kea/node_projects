<h1>Rendering</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        When working with Web Application there are 2 ways of rendering the page, SSR and CSR.
        They both has its own pro and cons and it varies which one you use depending on which
        kind of web application you have and what you focus on.

<h3 id="ssr">Server Side Rendering</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        SSR which stands for Server Side generates the whole page content and sends it to the client.
        Next.js which is a web framework that many web application use now uses SSR. In this project
        I've used SSR using Express. SSR is also best for SEO which may be important for websites like
        webshops.

        I have a template engine which contains a function that renders
        a page and that includes always implementing the sidebar and the footer so I don't have to 
        always write it for each HTML page and also makes it easier to make changes only in one place.

<h3 id="csr">Client Side Rendering</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        CSR which stands for Client Side Rendering uses Javascript to send content to the client. Many
        big frameworks like React, Angular and Vue uses CSR as it is good when working with dynamicaly 
        content.
