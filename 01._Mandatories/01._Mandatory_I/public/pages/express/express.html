<h1>Express</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        Express is a Node.js web application framework. Express makes it easier for developers
        to build webapps. In this course we use Express to serve HTML files and create API'.
        Express has many built-in features like routing (e.g. GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) and
        we are able to send files to the webbrowser using <code>sendFile()</code>. Express
        is a great tool when working with building web apps for both front- and backend.

<h3 id="rest-api">REST API</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        REST API is a web service that makes it possible to communicate between application and computers. It is something
        that you would find in most web applcations. Below is an representation of how REST API works, the client sends a
        request to the server which usually calls a database and then uses one of the HTTP methods like GET. 
        <img src="https://phpenthusiast.com/theme/assets/images/blog/what_is_rest_api.png" alt="restapi" width="600px">

        There are some principles we should remember when working with REST API. It is how we define our endpoints as 
        we've learned in the course to have some standards when making an API. Below is a table of how an REST API
        structure would look like. Let's use products as an example. We don't use <code>/getProducts</code> 
        or <code>/editProduct</code>. We should only use <code>/products</code> for all HTTP methods.
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>HTTP Methods</th>
            <th>Endpoints</th>
            <th>Explanation</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>GET</td>
            <td><code>/products</code></td>
            <td>Get all products</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>GET</td>
            <td><code>/products/{id}</code></td>
            <td>Get product by ID</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>POST</td>
            <td><code>/products</code></td>
            <td>Create a product</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>PUT</td>
            <td><code>/products/{id}</code></td>
            <td>Edit a product resource by ID</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>PATCH</td>
            <td><code>/products/{id}</code></td>
            <td>Edit a part of product by ID</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>DELETE</td>
            <td><code>/products/{id}</code></td>
            <td>Delete a product by ID</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

<h3 id="routers">Routers</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        Routers is a way to organize your code. Instead of having all your endpoints in 
        a single file, we can create routers which is implemented in Express. Below is an example
        of how you would implement it. 
        <pre>
            <code>
  import { Router } from 'express';
  const router = Router();

  router.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send(homePage);
  });
            </code>
        </pre>
        We create
        a routers in the project folder which contains all the http methods for that 
        specific category. It could be a <code>pagesRouter</code> and a <code>productsRouter</code>.
    </p>
