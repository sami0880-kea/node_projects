<h1>Tools</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        In the Full Stack Node.js course, we use a lot of different tools to boost
        our development workflow. Some of these are essential tools but other is a 
        nice-to-have to help making it easier when developing. 
    </p>

<h3 id="vs-code">VS Code</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        Visual Studio Code is a code editor made by Microsoft. This is the IDE we use in the course
        writing code. It's an easy and user-friendly code editor with built in tools like syntax
        highlighting. I've personally used VS Code for most of my projects both in the course
        and outside the course. It's personally my favourite IDE as it can be customized with themes
        and extensions.
    </p>

<h3 id="git">Git</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        Git is a version control that can keep a track of changes in your code. It is an essential
        tool to prevent faulty code so you're always able to go back if the new changes doesn't work.
        <br>
        <br> 
        In this course I use Github to host my git repositories which is a free tool to host your projects
        and easily share and access them on the web. Today Github has a lot of other features including 
        codespace where you're able to code inside your browser and projects which is a project management
        tool to also keep track of what to do and what's done.
        <br>
        <br>
        We've been told to remember 3 specific commands, we should remember these commands as they are
        essential in development. Below are the commands we use to add the changes, commmit them and 
        push them to our repository.
    </p>
</div>
<pre>
    <code class="language-powershell">
  // This git command stages all changes and adds the changes for the next commit
  $ git -add -A
    </code>
    <code class="language-powershell">
  // This git command commits the changes for the previous command with a message
  $ git commit -M "Message"
    </code>
    <code class="language-powershell">
  // This git command pushes all changes to our repository. I use Github to host my repositries.
  $ git push
    </code>
</pre>

<h3 id="node-js">Node.js</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        Node.js is a open source Javascript runtime enviroment. It runs on the V8 Javascript engine which is an engine
        made by Google and the leader developer is a Danish developer, Lars Bak. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In this course Node.js is essential as we can run code outside of our browser. We can also install dependencies
        like Express which requires Node.js and we use npm for that which will be described under. We can run .js files
        with node by running the following command:
        <pre>
            <code class="language-powershell">
  $ node 'file name.js'
            </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
</div>
<h4 id="npm">npm</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        npm which stands for Node Package Manager is included in Node.js. It is used to manage dependencies
        which we can use instead of writing new code that already exist. npm has a website where you're able
        to browse different dependencies that you can use in your code instead of writing it yourself.
    </p>
</div>
<h4 id="node_modules">node_modules</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        node_modules is the folder with all installed dependencies. When you install a dependency in your project
        this files is usually in the node_modules folder. It usually contains thousands of files which is why it's 
        important to add it to your .gitignore file. 
    </p>
</div>
<h4 id="package-json">package.json</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        package.json is the metadata of your code. It contains a list of installed dependencies, which version of the
        dependency you are using. It can also define the type of Javascript you are using <code>"type": "module"</code>
        will make your code run ECMAScript. This is what we usually in our projects in this course.
    </p>
</div>
<h3 id="nodemon">Nodemon</h3>
<div>
    <p>
        nodemon is tool that makes it easier to run your code in development. Instead of using the classic
        <code>node 'file name.js'</code>  we can use <code>nodemon 'file name.js'</code> which automatically restarts the application when 
        changes our made in the code. This is a useful tool especially when working with web application where
        you need to make a lot of changes and instead of manually restarting node it does it automatically.
        <br>
        <br>
        A key thing to remember as we use Server Side Rendering in the course now, is that we need to make sure to add
        additional extensions which makes the node projects. We need to make nodemon restart when there are changes in files
        like <code>js</code>, <code>json</code>, <code>html</code> and <code>css</code>. We can add this either directly in
        the command line with <code>nodemon 'file name.js' --ext js,json,html,css</code> or a smarter way is to add it
        in a <code>nodemon.json</code> file in our project. We can add this file which should contain following:
        <pre>
            <code>
    {
        "ext": "html,js,json,css"
    }
            </code>
        </pre>
        This will automatically add these extenstions when we run <code>nodemon 'file name.js</code> only.
    </p>
